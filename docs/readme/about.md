# About

This toolkit is part of the **CitiObs** project.

CitiObs (_Enhancing Citizen Observatories for healthy, sustainable, resilient and inclusive cities_) is a EU Project aimed at fostering inclusive, diverse, and stable citizen participation in the observation, monitoring, and protection of urban environments. The CO Participation Dynamics Toolkit empowers Citizen Observatories to build strong, trustworthy partnerships, navigate complex decisions, balance diverse perspectives, resolve conflicts constructively, increase data relevance, and identify sources of friction, ultimately fostering collaboration and collective growth.
