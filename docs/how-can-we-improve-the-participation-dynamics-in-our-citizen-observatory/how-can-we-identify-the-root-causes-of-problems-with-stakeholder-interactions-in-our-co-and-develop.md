# How can we identify the root causes of problems with stakeholder interactions in our CO and develop

## **Why is it relevant?**

A deep understanding of how to identify the underlying causes of issues related to stakeholder interactions within a CO is highly relevant for practitioners aiming to establish effective and sustainable solutions. The interactions between stakeholders serve as the backbone of effective COs, enabling the engagement and collaboration of diverse individuals, groups, and organisations to address pressing societal challenges. By investigating the root causes behind problems arising in these interactions, practitioners can gain valuable insights into the fundamental systemic barriers that impede fruitful collaboration and engagement. Such comprehension empowers organisers to address these core issues directly, rather than merely treating the surface-level symptoms. Consequently, they can develop strategies and approaches that foster enhanced stakeholder interactions, facilitating the formation of robust partnerships, fostering trust, and establishing an inclusive and empowering environment. This, in turn, unlocks the full potential of participants and paves the way for more impactful and sustainable outcomes.

## **How can it be done?**

### _Systems thinking_

Systems thinking is an analytical approach that allows us to understand complex systems by examining the relationships and interdependencies among their components. By using systems thinking, we can delve beyond surface-level symptoms and identify the underlying root causes of problems, recognising how various factors interact and influence the overall system dynamics.

One of the ways to look beyond surface-level symptoms, is to understand motivations for behaviour that may lead to problems in stakeholder interactions. By understanding the reasons for particular behaviours, we can begin to identify solutions. One framework through which to understand underlying motivations for behaviour was developed as part of the Ground Truth 2.0 initiative. Wehn and Almomani (2019) conducted an analysis of previous empirical research to gain insights into the influential factors affecting CO participation. The study identified both incentives and barriers, which were subsequently utilised to develop a systematic framework encompassing beliefs and domains. This framework was specifically tailored to examine the motivations and obstacles associated with the participation of key stakeholders in citizen engagement projects (including COs).

Another framework that can be used to understand motivations and barriers to participation (and thus root-cause issues behind stakeholder interaction) was developed by the WeSenseIt project. The WeSenseIt project engaged in comprehensive behavioural research to explore the motivations and barriers influencing citizens' participation in ICT-enabled COs, as well as the dynamics of governance participation. Social scientists collaborated closely with citizen and stakeholder groups throughout the project, developing theoretical and conceptual social models to deepen the understanding of citizen motivation, engagement, needs, abilities, preferences, and their potential contributions to decision-making processes. This collaborative approach fostered an exchange of experiences and feedback, facilitating innovative user involvement and the creation and maintenance of community networks. Furthermore, the project implemented effective data management strategies to enable the sharing of environmental data and information within an e-collaboration environment, thereby promoting crucial phases of social interaction that enhance participation in decision-making activities.
