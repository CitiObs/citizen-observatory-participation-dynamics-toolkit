# How can we ensure uptake of Citizen Observatory generated data?

## **Why is it relevant?**

Trust in CO generated data (both its quality and its potential for uptake and impact) is essential to ensure that citizens, policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders have confidence in the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of the data. Trust in data promotes informed decision-making, facilitates collaboration, and encourages the uptake of the observatory's findings. It allows participants to believe in the value of their work within COs, allowing them to actively engage in environmental monitoring and decision-making processes. It also empowers policymakers to make evidence-based policies, and enables researchers to utilise the data for scientific analysis and research. By building trust in the data, COs can foster a sense of ownership, credibility, and legitimacy, leading to increased acceptance and utilisation of the generated data for addressing environmental challenges and achieving sustainable outcomes.

## **How can it be done?**

There are various strategies to build trust in CO generated data. Crucial to this is to involve stakeholders in the governance of CO data, to foster trust and promote shared ownership. Establishing multi-stakeholder forums, advisory boards, or citizen panels allows for meaningful engagement and co-design of data collection, analysis, and utilisation processes. Participatory approaches like co-production and co-creation of data can enhance trust by valuing local knowledge and perspectives. The Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) framework offers principles and guidelines for inclusive and ethical data governance practices. Tools to follow RRI practices can be accessed via the RRI Tools Community ([https://rri-tools.eu/about-rri](https://rri-tools.eu/about-rri)). Additionally, collaborative platforms like the WeObserve Cookbook (WeObserve Consortium, 2021) provide resources and best practices for engaging stakeholders in COs, including data governance.

As part of these efforts, data quality assurance mechanisms can also be established, and their use communicated to stakeholders. Implementing robust data quality assurance mechanisms is essential to build trust in CO-generated data. This includes employing rigorous data collection protocols, utilising standardised monitoring methodologies, and ensuring data accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Tools such as the Open Data Kit (ODK) (opendatakit.org) can be used (or used as a template) to collect, validate, and manage data in a transparent and accountable manner. Additionally, establishing data validation processes, conducting regular quality checks, and involving independent experts for data verification can enhance the credibility and reliability of the data.

Transparency and openness are also key elements in building trust in data. COs can adopt FAIR data practices, as well as GDPR-compliant open data sharing, to make data accessible to all stakeholders, and provide clear documentation on data collection methods and protocols. Publishing data in open formats and utilising data visualisation tools, such as interactive maps or dashboards, can enhance data transparency, facilitate its interpretation by different stakeholders and allow participants to visibly see the impact of their data collection efforts. Platforms like the Open Data Toolkit ([https://codeforaotearoa.github.io/](https://codeforaotearoa.github.io/)) and the DPO Centre’s GDPR Policy Toolkit ([https://www.dpocentre.com/resources/gdpr-toolkit/](https://www.dpocentre.com/resources/gdpr-toolkit/)) provide guidance on data management practices and promote open and transparent data sharing.

By implementing these strategies and utilising relevant tools and approaches, COs can foster trust in data among citizens, policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders. Building trust in the data is a continuous process that requires ongoing engagement, transparency, and responsiveness to the needs and concerns of stakeholders. Ultimately, it strengthens the legitimacy and impact of COs in addressing environmental challenges and promoting sustainable decision-making.
